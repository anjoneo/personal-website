*updated 09/11/21*

*inspired by [Jeremy Maluf](https://jeremymaluf.com/things/)'s Favorite Things*

I always spend lots of time comparing and testing before commiting to something. 
I got my first Laptop in *2012* and since then I went though a vast amount of software, services and apps.


### Philosophy
*should check these points*

- privacy conscious
- free or one time purchase
- open source or trustable
- not bad looking and minimal
- free of redundancies
- 80+ % convenience (*of the popular choice*)

*or be replaced in the future*

These lists are very comprehensive, they also have the purpose of reference for me, when recommending software or setting up a new machine.
I leave out some apps like *Whatsapp*, because I don't like them but also can't really do without right now. 

I was thinking of doing a rating system for them *perfect/ok/looking for replacement* and might integrate this in the future.

I also like some of Jeremy Maluf's ideas behind his blog post:

> "...pages like this are also a great way for people to get a better picture of who you are if they donâ€™t know you yet. 
> Plus, writing a sentence about stuff you use ensures everything in your life has a purpose..." - Jeremy Maluf

Allthough I wouldn't call myself an apple fanboy, my computer and phone are both made by apple.

Thus some of the software might only be available for OSX or IOS.

Still I have used lots of OS in the past many apps are chosen from past experience.
- Windows: XP, 7, 10
- Linux: Debian, Arch, Mint, Ubuntu, Kali, Elementary, Manjaro ...
