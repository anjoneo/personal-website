*updated 09/11/21*

*inspired by [Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/)'s Impossible Lists*

I made this list so that I can see my goals and be held acountable for what i achieve and what not.

> "Put simply, the impossible list is an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action. This is mine, which is, of course, ever-evolving." - [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/)
